      <p class="p5"><h3>Interest Rates:</h3>

        Compare the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of different loans, which includes both the interest rate and any fees.

        <br>
       <h3> Loan Amount:</h3>
        Determine how much you need to borrow and ensure the lender offers that amount.
        Be mindful of borrowing only what you need to avoid unnecessary debt.
        <br>
       <h3>Loan Term:</h3>
        Shorter terms generally mean higher monthly payments but less interest paid over the life of the loan.
        Longer terms mean lower monthly payments but more interest paid over time.
        <br>
      <h3>Fees and Charges:</h3>
        Origination Fees: Some lenders charge a fee to process the loan.
        Prepayment Penalties: Check if there are penalties for paying off the loan early.
